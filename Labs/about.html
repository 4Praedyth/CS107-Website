    <h1>About Matthew Lungu</h1><br>
    
    <p1>
        I'm a Computer Science student with a profound enthusiasm for software development and engineering. My academic journey has allowed me to explore diverse areas, such as creating AI-driven user interaction projects and developing Java-based reaction test applications with graphical user interfaces.<br><br>

        I am currently seeking opportunities to apply and expand my skills in a real-world setting and am actively looking for a Summer 2024 internship.<br><br>

        Beyond the technical realm, I'm deeply passionate about Track and Field, where I compete at a high level, instilling in me a commitment to hard work and dedication. Outside of my studies and athletics, I've ventured into entrepreneurship, co-founding a local summer business with friends. Our mission is to assist our community, with a variety of physically demanding tasks, providing valuable support and fostering a sense of community.<br><br>
