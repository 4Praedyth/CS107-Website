        <h2>Vanilla ice cream</h2>
            <p>Can't go wrong with the original best flavor, this is definitely a 10/10 flavor.</p>
    
        <h2>Chocolate ice cream </h2>
        <p>Honestly, this one is extremely biased. I don't like chocolate flavored ice cream so this one is a 2/10 with the points being for creativity.</p>
    
        <h2>Oreo ice cream </h2>
        <p>You can never expect this flavor to be bad, this flavor is litteral godsend, a blessing from above, a creation of heaven. If you don't like oreo ice cream then you are missing out. 11/10 for sure.</p>
    
        <h2>Mint ice cream </h2>
        <p>Suprisingly a lot of people don't like this flavor but aside from it being the toothpaste flavor, this is actually one of the best flavors. Mix this with oreo and its perfect. 8.5/10</p>
